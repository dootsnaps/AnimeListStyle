# AnimeListStyle

*UPDATE FEB 24 2024: Style only uses one scrolling background image now instead of several. I have been unable to resolve the pinned issue and as such i might as well at least make a style that vaguely works instead of one that is totally broken.*

CSS for classic [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net) lists with a parallax-scrolling background effect. 

Example usage:
